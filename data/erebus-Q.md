Addresses parameters can be 0 which updates state variables without verifying them (it can be solved though, that's why it is a QA). The occurrences are [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOV3Admin.sol#L521) (one of them, and only one, could be 0), [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOV3Admin.sol#L505) and [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOV3Admin.sol#L530). Revert if it is `address(0)`
