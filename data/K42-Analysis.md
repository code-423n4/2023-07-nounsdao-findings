## Advanced Analysis Report for [NounsDAO](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/tree/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts)

### Overview: 
- NounsDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a unique project that combines the elements of digital art and blockchain technology. The main product of NounsDAO is the Nouns, which are unique, programmatically generated pieces of digital art that are minted and auctioned off each day. The proceeds from these auctions are directed to the NounsDAO treasury, which is governed by Nouns token holders.

### Understanding the Ecosystem: 
- The NounsDAO ecosystem is built around the Nouns, the unique pieces of digital art. These Nouns are minted and auctioned off each day, with the proceeds going to the NounsDAO treasury. The treasury is governed by the holders of the Nouns tokens, who can vote on proposals regarding the use of the treasury funds. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where the creation and sale of Nouns fund the DAO, and the DAO is governed by the token holders who have a vested interest in the success of the project.

### Architecture Recommendations: 
- I have suggested optimization, which I left out of my gas report due to it being a structural change, therefore I recommended it here instead, see below: 

- Possible Optimization in [ForkDAODeployer.sol](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/ForkDAODeployer.sol)

- In the [deployForkDAO](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/fork/ForkDAODeployer.sol#L92C1-L129C6) function, the current implementation deploys four new contracts (token, auction, governor, treasury) using the ERC1967Proxy contract. Each deployment of a contract involves a CREATE opcode which is quite expensive in terms of gas. We can optimize this by using a CREATE2 opcode which allows us to deploy a contract at a deterministic address. This would reduce the gas cost as CREATE2 is cheaper than CREATE and also provides additional benefits like being able to compute the address of the contract before it's deployed.

Before:

``token = address(new ERC1967Proxy(tokenImpl, ''));
address auction = address(new ERC1967Proxy(auctionImpl, ''));
address governor = address(new ERC1967Proxy(governorImpl, ''));
treasury = address(new ERC1967Proxy(treasuryImpl, ''));``

After Optimization:

``bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenImpl, auctionImpl, governorImpl, treasuryImpl));
token = deployContract(tokenImpl, salt);
auction = deployContract(auctionImpl, salt);
governor = deployContract(governorImpl, salt);
treasury = deployContract(treasuryImpl, salt);``

``function deployContract(address implementation, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address) {
    bytes20 targetBytes = bytes20(implementation);
    address result;
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
        let clone := mload(0x40)
        mstore(clone, 0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73000000000000000000000000)
        mstore(add(clone, 0x14), targetBytes)
        mstore(add(clone, 0x28), 0x5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf30000000000000000000000000000000000)
        result := create2(0, clone, 0x37, salt)
    }
    return result;
}``

Estimated gas saved = The exact gas savings would depend on the size of the contracts being deployed. However, as a rough estimate, the CREATE opcode costs 32000 gas, while the CREATE2 opcode costs 20000 gas. Therefore, for each contract deployment, we save approximately 12000 gas. Since we are deploying four contracts, the total gas saved is approximately 48000 gas.

- Other than this, the current architecture of NounsDAO is robust and well-designed, as the project grows and evolves, it may benefit from a more modular architecture. This would involve breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, which v3 seems to offer well. This approach can improve the maintainability of the code and make it easier to add new features in the future.

### Centralization Risks: 
- As a DAO, NounsDAO is designed to be decentralized, with decision-making power distributed among the holders of the governance token. However, like all DAOs, it faces the risk of centralization if a small number of entities acquire a large portion of the governance tokens. This could allow them to exert disproportionate influence over the DAO's decisions. To mitigate this risk, it's important to ensure a fair and wide distribution of the governance tokens.

### Mechanism Review:
- The mechanism of auctioning off Nouns and directing the proceeds to the DAO's treasury is a novel and effective way of generating value for the DAO and its token holders. However, it's important to ensure that the auction process is fair and transparent, and that the value of the Nouns is not artificially inflated.

### Systemic Risks:
- The systemic risks for NounsDAO include the overall volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market, potential regulatory changes, and the reliance on the Ethereum blockchain, which itself faces issues such as scalability and high transaction fees.

### Areas of Concern
- One area of concern could be the sustainability of the daily auction model. While it is a novel approach, it's important to consider whether this model can sustain interest and participation in the long term. given the context of current activity, NounsDAO is leading the way in this already. Additionally, the reliance on the Ethereum network could pose challenges due to high gas fees and scalability issues, therefore I did my best on a gas report to further optimize this project to increase its longevity and sustainability. 

### Codebase Analysis
- The codebase of NounsDAO is well-structured and follows best practices for smart contract development. It makes use of well-tested libraries and frameworks such as OpenZeppelin for implementing standard functionalities. The code is modular, which makes it easier to understand and maintain. It also has extensive comments, which aids in understanding the functionality of different parts of the code.

- However, the complexity of the system also poses potential risks. With so many interacting components, there is a higher chance of unexpected behaviour or vulnerabilities. Therefore, thorough future testing and auditing are crucial to ensure the security of the system.

### Recommendations
- Consider a even more modular architecture to improve maintainability and ease of adding new features.

- Ensure a fair and wider distribution of governance tokens to mitigate centralization risks.

- Regularly review and update the auction mechanism to ensure fairness and transparency.

- Explore solutions for potential scalability issues and high transaction fees on the Ethereum network.

### Conclusion
- NounsDAO is a unique and innovative project that combines the concepts of NFTs and DAOs and I had fun auditing the project. Its daily auction model is a novel approach to generating value for the DAO and its token holders. However, like all projects in the crypto space, it faces potential risks and challenges that need to be carefully managed. With a well-structured and maintained codebase, and by following best practices for DAO governance, NounsDAO has the potential of longevity, and to be a notable and influential project in the NFT and DAO space, even in 5 years from now.
