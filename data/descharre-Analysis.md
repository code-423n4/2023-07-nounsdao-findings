Overall it was a really solid codebase, I've been in NFT's for a few years now. And I always looked up to nouns. NFT projects are my favourite audits. Still need some more experience in proxies because that's where I'm lacking.

The approach I took for this codebase was to first go over all the code and leave some notes. After I went over all the code, I reviewed every note I took. I feel like this isn't the best practice and I should change this in the future. 

Next time I want to try to immediately go in depth to my notes when I first review the code. I think that's when I'm the most focused and motivated.
