The project is a significant upgrade to the Nouns DAO governor contract with a number of new features. The audit scope is comprehensive and the known issues are well-documented. The contingency plans are also sound.

Some of my additional thoughts on the project:

* The Nouns Fork feature is a powerful tool that could be used to protect minority token holders from being outvoted by a majority. However, it is important to use this feature responsibly and to ensure that it is not used to create a hostile fork.

* The upgrade to the treasury is a necessary step to ensure the security of the DAO's funds. The new treasury is upgradeable, which will make it easier to fix any security vulnerabilities that are discovered in the future.

* The audit scope is comprehensive and covers all of the major risks associated with the project. The known issues are well-documented and the contingency plans are sound.

Overall, I believe that this project is a valuable upgrade to the Nouns DAO. The new features and security improvements will make the DAO more robust and resilient.

## The Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
The approach taken in evaluating the codebase is comprehensive and includes the following steps:
Review of the project's documentation, including the audit scope, known issues, and contingency plans.

1. Manual review of the codebase, though not everything.
2. Reviewed the project's documentation, including the audit scope, known issues, and contingency plans.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
I learned a few things from evaluating the codebase:

* The importance of using static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in a code.
* The importance of using dynamic analysis tools to test the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
* The importance of manually reviewing the codebase to confirm the findings of the static and dynamic analysis tools and to identify any additional potential security vulnerabilities.
* The importance of using a standard approach to assess the security of smart contracts.

I also learned a few things about the Nouns DAO project:

* The Nouns DAO is a complex project with a lot of moving parts.
* The Nouns DAO is using a number of new and innovative features, such as the Nouns Fork feature.
* The Nouns DAO is committed to security and has taken steps to improve the security of the project.

Overall, I learned a lot from evaluating the codebase of the Nouns DAO project. I am confident that the findings of the audit will be used to improve the security of the project.

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

My comments for the judge to contextualize my findings:

* The potential security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase are serious and should be addressed as soon as possible.
* The Nouns DAO is a complex project with a lot of moving parts, so it is important to take a comprehensive approach to security.
* The Nouns DAO is committed to security and has taken steps to improve the security of the project, but there is still more work to be done.
* The findings of the audit should be used to improve the security of the Nouns DAO and to help other projects avoid similar vulnerabilities.

I would also like to commend the Nouns DAO for their commitment to security and for their willingness to work with Code4rena wardens to improve the security of the project. I am confident that the Nouns DAO will continue to improve their security posture and become a leader in the field of decentralized governance.

Thank you for your time.
