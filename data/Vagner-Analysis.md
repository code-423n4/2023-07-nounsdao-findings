The approach that I have taken in this evaluating this codebase is similar to other codebases, I read the code at a very low level at first to see if there are any inconsistencies in the codebase or logic flaws then I try to understand it as effective as possible from a high level perspective to see if the implementation is done right. The thing that I learned from evaluating this project is how a complete DAO would look like with complete functionality and also how you can use ERC721 to vote in governance systems instead of ERC20.
