# Approach
My approach towards Nouns Dao audit contest was based usually like previous first in area of going through previous audits and automated findings to avoid issues that are already found or known.
Afterwards, I go through description provided on contest page to understand the operational working of codebase. Then i started my auditing process which was first look for optimisation and QA findings. After finishing from low issues then i started to look for medium and high severity issues and lucky to find some medium issues.
# Learning
My learning from this project is to understand the Compound protocol in more depth as it is being forked by many projects that will help me in upgrading my skills to remain competitive in the space.

# Comments
My findings are mainly based on old code practice that exists in the project leading to opening potential for attacks in future due to rapid advancement in the Ethereum ecosystem.
