This was my first audit but I had been studying and was excited. The first step I took was to familiarize myself with the codebase. I looked at the overall architecture and design of the project, and how the different contracts interacted with each other. This gave me a general understanding of the project's structure and its main components, which are essential for the next steps of the audit.

After getting a sense of the project's overall design, I started by focusing on the main contracts as identified in the initial scope. I learned a lot from this code audit as it was my first audit contest. It was an enriching experience as I had the opportunity to dive deep into the code and understand the various aspects and intricacies of a large project. The process of understanding how the main components work together, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and creating test cases to validate these vulnerabilities was neat.

One of the key takeaways from this audit was the importance of having a strong understanding of how the different contracts interact and function together.

The test cases provided in the codebase were also very helpful in understanding how the contracts are intended to function and the expected behavior of the system. By studying these tests, I was able to gain insights into how to create my own tests and identify potential edge cases and vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that while this audit has identified potential vulnerabilities, it does not guarantee the complete security of the system. It's always recommended to conduct multiple rounds of audits and testing to ensure the robustness and security of the system.
