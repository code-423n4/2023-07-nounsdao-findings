MISSING ZERO-ADDRESS CHECK IN CONSTRUCTOR
https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsArt.sol#L59C1-L62

Missing checks for zero-addresses may lead to infunctional protocol, if the variable addresses are set  incorrectly.
variable: address _descriptor, IInflator _inflator

Consider adding zero-address checks in the discussed constructors:
require(address _descriptor != address(0));
require(address _inflator != address(0));
