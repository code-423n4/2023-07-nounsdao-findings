## What did you learn from reviewing this codebase? Be specific.
During the review of this codebase, I gained a deep understanding of the core structure and functionalities of DAOs, specifically focusing on the voting system within them. The project provided valuable insights into the architecture and design of DAOs, and how they are being used to revolutionize the concept of DAO forks. Additionally, I delved into the topic of contract upgradeability and the associated risks that come with it, such as ensuring smooth transitions and preventing unintended vulnerabilities.

## What approach did you take in evaluating this codebase in order to help you grow your skills and code review resources?
In evaluating this codebase, I primarily conducted a manual review, going through the codebase line by line. I referred to the provided documentation and also consulted relevant tests whenever I encountered values or functionalities that required further clarification. My approach involved:

1- Gaining a high-level understanding of the project by studying the documentation on the code4rena contest page.
2- Reviewing the codebase quickly to familiarize myself with the implementation, paying close attention to new terms and concepts. I conducted additional research to deepen my understanding of these unfamiliar elements.
3- Creating a visual diagram or drawing to map the connections and interactions between the contracts, enabling me to comprehend the overall architecture.
4- Beginning the audit process by carefully reading the documentation alongside the corresponding code section being audited.
5- Whenever I suspected a vulnerability, I paused to search for similar vulnerabilities in previous reports using **solodit** or other available resources.
While I did not discover any major vulnerabilities (M/H), I identified some non-critical issues (NC) and suggested gas optimizations that could enhance the codebase efficiency and reduce gas consumption.
