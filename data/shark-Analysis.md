## Comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
I submitted 1 high, 4 mediums along with additional inputs in the Gas and QA reports. It's worth noting that loopholes still abound depending on how you would visualize the codebase both short and long terms. Here are the breakdown of the HM findings in their condensed forms:

1. Any signer can still have a pending/active/queue proposal cancelled to grief the proposal process
A recently discovered vulnerability in a DAO system could allow a small malicious group to unilaterally cancel proposals, potentially leading to major disruptions and a lack of trust in the system. This flaw originates from the ability to transfer voting power to other addresses prior to invoking the cancel function. To exploit it, a group could first have their signatures included in a proposal, then delegate their votes to other addresses, decreasing the total vote count below the proposal threshold and enabling any signer to cancel the proposal. The issue could be mitigated by restricting proposal cancellation to the proposer or implementing a cooldown period or vote-locking mechanism to prevent signers from manipulating their voting power.  
2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks` can be dodged to have undesirable proposal executed
The report describes a vulnerability in the DAO system where a savvy minority could manipulate the voting process to push through proposals not in the majority's interests. They can achieve this by timing their votes to switch the proposal from defeated to successful just before the last-minute window period (`ds.lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`) can be triggered, preventing the initialization of the objection period (`proposal.objectionPeriodEndBlock`). Consequently, this could result in proposals being executed that do not benefit the majority of DAO members. The proposed mitigation step is to implement a monitoring system that alerts DAO members when the vote count nears the last-minute window threshold, allowing the majority to respond if an unexpected swing in votes occurs.
3. Inequitable distribution of funds when quitting DAO due to token opt-out
The report highlights a vulnerability in the `NounsDAOLogicV1Fork.sol` contract, where participants who opt out of receiving certain ERC20 tokens when they quit the DAO do not receive any compensation for the value of these tokens. As a result, they receive less than their fair share of the DAO's funds, leading to an imbalance in fund distribution. This situation may deter potential participants, especially from jurisdictions where certain tokens are illegal. The code responsible for this is within the quitInternal function, where the balance to send is calculated but doesn't account for redistribution of the opted-out tokens. A suggested solution is to introduce a token swap function, which would let quitting users receive equivalent value in an accepted form, like USDC. This, however, could introduce new complexities and risks such as price oracle manipulation and sandwich attack risks.
4. Potential risks associated with Nouns Fork
The `NounsDAOLogicV1Fork.sol` contract presents a vulnerability in the DAO's governance model where the departure of token holders decreases the `adjustedTotalSupply`, thereby lowering the proposal threshold and making it easier for remaining members to pass potentially harmful proposals. This could incite a vicious cycle of token holders departing in response to these proposals, progressively lowering the total supply and proposal threshold, eventually leading to a "ghost DAO" with few or no active participants. This can disrupt the purpose of the DAO, possibly leading to a decrease in token value and a decline in community involvement. The situation also undermines the new Auction House where new Nouns are minted and auctioned daily, which could see lower bids or no bidders at all. To mitigate this, it's suggested to implement a function logic that increases the proposal threshold as the total supply decreases, helping to maintain a healthy community. 
5. Double entry tokens
The `checkForDuplicates` function in the DAO contract doesn't adequately address the problem of Double Entry Tokens, where tokens have multiple contract addresses representing different versions of the same token. If a DAO fork or a member exit occurs, the presence of these tokens could lead to a greater than prorata share being sent to the fork DAO treasury or the quitting member, causing a loss of funds for the original DAO. Despite the low likelihood, the high impact of this issue, such as significant loss of funds, categorizes it as a medium severity issue. To mitigate this, it's suggested to maintain a registry of known token contract migrations and treat different addresses representing the same token as duplicates, thus preventing the potential loss of DAO funds.

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
While the codebase is comparatively easy to understand, comprehending the true business logic and intention is not. I needed to go through the specs numerous times and eventually approached Spearbit's draft audit reports. That's where I started seeing some vulnerabilities that might not have been fully mitigated. And as I worked on better fixes, other vulnerabilities, both mediums and lows, began to surface.  

## Architecture recommendations
There are quite a number of redundant codes that I have reported in the Gas report. There should be more of similar issues to detect and suggest. One of them that I have not included in the report, for instance, is the long list of identical events in `NounsDAOV3Admin.sol` that could have been skimmed considering these events have been included in the import `./NounsDAOInterfaces.sol`.   

## Codebase quality analysis
The codebase is overall well structured with ample NatSpec comments attached, facilitating the need to link up all needed flows and function calls. It would have been better had some form of flow charts been provided. This would be crucially helpful to someone who has limited background of the protocol and the business intentions entailed.

## Centralization risks
There shouldn't be much concern here considering the protocol is so much DAO based where almost all changes would need to go through the governance except for a simple bypass where the treasury gets to migrate funds to the new executor without the need going through a proposal. Nonetheless, much power still lies in the hands of vetoers in the V3 logic, a feature that has sensibly been removed in the forked DAO. 

## Mechanism review
Upon reviewing the DAO's mechanisms, it is clear that several aspects could pose vulnerabilities, especially in light of the planned DAO fork. The DAOâ€™s governance model and mechanisms can be exposed to different forms of manipulation such as 'Griefing the proposal process' and 'Manipulation of last-minute voting'. This could lead to an imbalance in power and decision-making, potentially resulting in proposals being passed that are not in the best interest of the community at large.

Additionally, the management of ERC20 tokens, specifically the handling of Double Entry Tokens and equitable distribution of funds when a member quits, reveal the need for improvement. Current mechanisms do not fully cater to the unique challenges of these scenarios, potentially leading to the loss of DAO funds or an inequitable distribution of funds.

Lastly, the potential systemic risks that arise with the DAO fork should not be overlooked. While it represents an innovative and bold step in DAO governance, it introduces complexities and risks such as the decrease in proposal thresholds and a potential devaluation of tokens.

It is thus highly recommended to review and revise these mechanisms, keeping in mind the lessons learned from the reported vulnerabilities and recommendations provided to ensure a more robust and resilient DAO system.  

## Systemic risks
Nouns DAO is laudable for the first ever DAO fork not seen in the industry. Nonetheless, the rush to deliver V3 and its fork could potentially bring in issues and threats other than the known ones, as I have reported in my findings. Ultimately, it all boils down to sustainability of both the original and forked DAO amidst the tradeoffs in possibly diluting the token values due to foreseeable increased supply collectively.
