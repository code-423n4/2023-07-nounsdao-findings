### QA Report by K42: A General Optimization. 

### General Optimization: For longevity, use ``uint64`` for storing block numbers: 

- Specifically in the contract [NounsDAOV3Proposals.sol](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/718211e063d511eeda1084710f6a682955e80dcb/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/governance/NounsDAOV3Proposals.sol) you are currently using ``uint64`` for storing block numbers. However, Ethereum block numbers are expected to exceed ``uint64`` in the future, so it would be safer to use ``uint256``. This change would not save gas, but it would prevent potential overflow issues in the future.
