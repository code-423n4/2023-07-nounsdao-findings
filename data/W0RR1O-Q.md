##[L-01] Suggestion to Upgrade from ERC721 to ERC721A for Improved Functionality


## Description:
The current implementation of the DAO's non-fungible tokens (NFTs) relies on the ERC721 standard. However, it is recommended to consider upgrading to the ERC721A standard to leverage additional features and capabilities that can enhance the functionality and usability of the NFTs within the DAO ecosystem.

## Impact:
By upgrading to ERC721A, the DAO can benefit from the following improvements:

1. `Batch Transfers`: ERC721A introduces batch transfer functionality, allowing multiple NFTs to be transferred in a single transaction. This can simplify the process of managing and transferring large collections of NFTs, leading to improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

2. `Safe Transfer`: ERC721A includes a safeTransferFromBatch function that enhances the safety of NFT transfers by providing a callback mechanism. This helps prevent accidental token loss and ensures successful transfers, thereby reducing the risk of user error.

3. `Metadata Extensions`: ERC721A supports additional metadata extensions, enabling the storage of supplementary data or attributes related to NFTs. This can provide valuable information about NFT provenance, history, or additional properties, enhancing the overall value and utility of the NFTs.

4. `Enumerability`: ERC721A includes functions for enumerating NFTs within a contract, making it easier to retrieve lists of tokens and perform operations on specific subsets of NFTs. This can facilitate improved management and interaction with NFT collections.

Recommendation:
It is recommended that the DAO consider upgrading its NFT implementation from ERC721 to ERC721A to take advantage of the aforementioned benefits. The upgrade can be performed by implementing the ERC721A standard in the existing smart contract or by deploying a new contract that conforms to ERC721A.
